# RC-Carduino (WIP)
A 3D-printed, WiFi-enabled RC car using Arduino and RTC with a custom app.

Hardware used:
  - Microcontroller (I chose the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi for this)
  - Dual motor driver (TB6612FNG or the L298N)
  - 2x DC motors
  - 1x 9g Servo motor
  - 7.4V LiPo Battery
  - Step Down Buck Converter 5V to 3.3V
  - M3 Screws and nuts
  - Chassis

Features:
  - Forward / Backward / Stop controls
  - Steering
  - WiFi Remote App (Arduino IoT Cloud or you could do a Java app)
          - I plan on creating a custom controller with its own transmitter.
  - 3D-printed Chassis

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS HERE (WIP)
